The dataset contains magnetic resonance images. This is a multi-label classification task, meaning that we have to accurately classify the medical images with respect to three possible classes, where each image might belong to more than one class.
The trainset is composed of 12.000 images, the validation set of 3.000 images and the test set of 5000 images.
